# Skin Cancer melanoma classifier
Introducing a cutting-edge machine learning study that focuses on accurately classifying skin cancer. By utilising TensorFlow's Keras' VGG16 architecture, the model achieves a remarkable 94.5% accuracy in classifying skin lesions as benign or malignant. This achievement is made feasible by using Django to deploy the model and create a backend service with an intuitive user interface. Users can easily submit photographs for analysis, and they will quickly receive predictions with corresponding likelihood scores. By empowering people to proactively identify probable skin cancer instances, this innovation enables them to make educated decisions about their health.
